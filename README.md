# Location Feature Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement a feature that gets the user's location when a button is clicked and displays it on the screen.

## 1. Add Location Dependency

First, I will add the Google Play Services location dependency to the `app/build.gradle.kts` file. This will allow us to use the `FusedLocationProviderClient` to get the user's location.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:21.2.0")
}
```

## 2. Add Location Permissions

Next, I will add the necessary location permissions to the `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file. This is required to access the user's location.

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    ...
</manifest>
```

## 3. Update the UI and Logic in `MainActivity.kt`

Finally, I will update the `MainActivity.kt` file to include:

*   A `Button` to trigger the location request.
*   A `Text` element to display the location.
*   The logic to request location permissions from the user.
*   The logic to get the last known location using `FusedLocationProviderClient` and update the UI.

I will use Jetpack Compose for the UI elements. The code will handle the permission request flow and update the UI with the location data.

Once you approve this plan, I will proceed with the implementation.
