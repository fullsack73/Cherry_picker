We're continuing our implementation of Card Recommendation Feature by implementing task group number 1:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

### Database Layer

#### Task Group 1: Schema + Ingestion Upgrades
**Assigned implementer:** database-engineer  
**Dependencies:** None

- [ ] 1.0 Complete database layer
  - [ ] 1.1 Write 3-4 focused sqlite-based tests validating `is_location_based` ingestion and query helpers (cover migration default, CSV parsing, and filtering order).
  - [ ] 1.2 Create migration adding `is_location_based INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to `card_benefits`, plus indexes on `(card_id, is_location_based)` and `(normalized_category, is_location_based)` per standards/backend/migrations.md.
  - [ ] 1.3 Update `src/ingest/loadData.js` to parse the CSV field, normalize truthy values, and persist the flag while preserving existing category mapping.
  - [ ] 1.4 Extend `src/queries/cards.js` (or new helper) so recommendation consumers can fetch location-priority benefit rows without resorting to raw SQL.
  - [ ] 1.5 Run ONLY the tests from 1.1 to confirm migration + ingestion + query logic, do not execute the entire backend suite.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tests from 1.1 pass on local sqlite DB.
- Migration applies/rolls back cleanly and keeps existing data intact.
- Ingestion writes accurate `is_location_based` values for every benefit row.
- Query helpers expose `is_location_based` without breaking current `/api/cards` responses.

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-12-01-card-recommendation-feature/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.

## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.

## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-12-01-card-recommendation-feature/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:

```markdown
