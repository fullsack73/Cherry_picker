# Task Breakdown: User Location Acquisition

## Overview
Total Tasks: 10
Assigned roles: [android-engineer, api-engineer, testing-engineer]

## Task List

### Android Client

#### Task Group 1: Location Feature Implementation
**Assigned implementer:** android-engineer
**Dependencies:** None

- [x] 1.0 Complete location feature implementation
  - [x] 1.1 Write 2-4 focused tests for the location acquisition flow.
    - Test the permission request logic.
    - Test the location retrieval success and failure cases.
  - [x] 1.2 Implement location permission request logic.
    - Request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`.
    - Handle permission granted and denied scenarios.
  - [x] 1.3 Implement location acquisition logic.
    - Use the `FusedLocationProviderClient` as identified in the spec.
    - Retrieve the user's current location on app launch and on refresh button click.
  - [x] 1.4 Implement UI feedback.
    - Add a "refresh" button to the UI.
    - Display a loading spinner while acquiring location.
  - [x] 1.5 Ensure Android feature tests pass.
    - Run ONLY the tests written in 1.1.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The tests written in 1.1 pass.
- The app correctly requests and handles location permissions.
- The app acquires the user's location on launch and on refresh.
- The UI displays a refresh button and a loading spinner correctly.

### API Layer

#### Task Group 2: API Integration
**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1

- [ ] 2.0 Complete API integration
  - [ ] 2.1 Write 1-2 focused tests for the API client.
    - Test that the location is sent to the correct endpoint.
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement the API client to send location data.
    - Create a method to send a `POST` request to `/user-location` with latitude and longitude.
    - This might involve using a networking library like Retrofit or Ktor.
  - [ ] 2.3 Ensure API integration tests pass.
    - Run ONLY the tests written in 2.1.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The tests written in 2.1 pass.
- The location data is successfully sent to the backend endpoint.

### Testing

#### Task Group 3: Test Review & Gap Analysis
**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-2

- [ ] 3.0 Review existing tests and fill critical gaps only
  - [ ] 3.1 Review tests from Task Groups 1 and 2.
  - [ ] 3.2 Analyze test coverage for the user location feature and identify any critical gaps.
  - [ ] 3.3 Write up to 5 additional strategic tests maximum to cover critical end-to-end workflows.
  - [ ] 3.4 Run all feature-specific tests and verify they pass.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature-specific tests pass.
- Critical user workflows for the location feature are covered.
- No more than 5 additional tests are added.
