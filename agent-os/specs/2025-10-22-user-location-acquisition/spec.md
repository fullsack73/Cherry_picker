# Specification: User Location Acquisition

## Goal
To implement a mechanism to obtain the user's precise geographical location, which is then sent to a backend server for processing to retrieve card recommendations.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want the app to automatically get my location on first launch so I can get relevant recommendations without manual steps.
- As a user, I want to be able to refresh my location so I can get updated recommendations based on my current position.

## Core Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Acquire user's precise location on app launch.
- Acquire user's location on "refresh" button click.
- Prompt user for location permissions if not granted.
- Send location data to a backend server.
- Show a loading spinner while getting location.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Location accuracy should be high (GPS level).
- The app should handle cases where location services are disabled gracefully.

## Visual Design
- No mockups provided.
- A simple loading spinner should be implemented as a feedback mechanism during location acquisition.

## Reusable Components
### Existing Code to Leverage
- **Components**: `MainActivity.kt` already contains code to get `FusedLocationProviderClient` and call `getCurrentLocation`. This should be reused and built upon.
- **Services**: None found.
- **Patterns**: The existing code uses the modern `FusedLocationProviderClient` API, which should be the standard for this implementation.

### New Components Required
- No new major components are required. The existing `MainActivity` can be extended to house the location logic for this feature. A helper class could be created for better organization if the logic becomes complex.

## Technical Approach
### Database
- No local database storage of location is required.

### API
- An API endpoint will be called to send the latitude and longitude to the backend.
- **Endpoint**: `POST /user-location`
- **Request Body**: 
```json
{
  "latitude": float,
  "longitude": float
}
```
- This aligns with RESTful design principles.

### Frontend
- Request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission at runtime.
- Implement a "refresh" button in the UI.
- Display a loading spinner while location is being acquired.
- If permission is denied, the app should clearly communicate to the user why the permission is needed.
- The implementation should follow responsive design best practices to ensure a good experience on different devices.

### Testing
- In line with the testing standards, tests will focus on the core user flow.
- An instrumented test to verify the location permission request flow and the UI feedback (loading spinner).
- A unit test for any logic that processes the location data before sending it to the backend.

## Out of Scope
- Adherence to privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA (as this is a prototype).
- Complex UI for location acquisition beyond a simple loading spinner.
- Storing location data on the device.

## Success Criteria
- The user's location is successfully sent to the backend server upon app launch and on refresh.
- The app correctly handles the location permission process, including denial.
- The UI provides clear feedback to the user during location acquisition.
