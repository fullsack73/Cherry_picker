# Spec Requirements: User Location Acquisition

## Initial Description
User Location Acquisition â€” Implement functionality to securely obtain and process the user's current geographical location.

## Requirements Discussion

### First Round Questions

**Q1:** I assume location acquisition will be triggered automatically when the app needs it (e.g., on app launch or when searching for nearby stores). Is that correct, or will there be a manual trigger (e.g., a button)?
**Answer:** the app has to first retreive user location on initial launch, and do it whenever the user clicks 'refresh" button

**Q2:** What level of location accuracy is required? I'm assuming a precise GPS location (within a few meters) is needed for accurate store proximity. Is that correct, or is a broader location (e.g., city-level) sufficient?
**Answer:** yes. we need to deduct precise location. accuracy is important.

**Q3:** How should the application handle scenarios where the user denies location permissions or has location services disabled? Should it prompt the user to enable them, or gracefully degrade functionality?
**Answer:** we should prompt user to allow location permission.

**Q4:** Will the acquired location data be stored on the device or sent to a backend server? If stored, what is the retention policy and how will it be secured?
**Answer:** there will be a backend server for credit card, shop location data. we need to send it user location to server so the backend can do it's thing and returns a recommended card(s)

**Q5:** Are there any specific privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) or internal privacy policies that need to be strictly adhered to when handling user location data?
**Answer:** no. this isn't meant to be distributed or go production level. the app and data will go nowhere, so we don't need to care about privacy regulations

**Q6:** What kind of user feedback or UI indication should be provided while the app is actively acquiring the user's location (e.g., a loading spinner, a "Getting your location..." message)?
**Answer:** a simple loading spinner will have to do.

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
- The app must acquire the user's precise geographical location on initial launch.
- The app must acquire the user's precise geographical location when a "refresh" button is clicked.
- The app must prompt the user to allow location permissions if denied.
- The app must send the acquired user location to a backend server.
- A simple loading spinner should be displayed while location is being acquired.

### Reusability Opportunities
None identified.

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- Initial location acquisition on app launch.
- Location acquisition on "refresh" button click.
- Prompting for location permissions.
- Sending location data to a backend server.
- Displaying a loading spinner during acquisition.

**Out of Scope:**
- Adherence to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for this prototype.
- Complex UI for location acquisition beyond a simple loading spinner.

### Technical Considerations
- Integration with Android's location services API.
- Network communication to send location data to a backend server.
