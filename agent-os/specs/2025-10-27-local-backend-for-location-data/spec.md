# Specification: Local Backend for Location Data

## Goal
To establish a local backend server that can receive and process location data sent from the mobile application, transitioning from mock API usage to a real local API endpoint.

## User Stories
- As an app developer, I want a local backend server to receive location data so that I can test the app's location sending functionality with a real endpoint.
- As an app developer, I want the local backend to log received location data so that I can verify the data being sent from the app.
- As an app developer, I want the local backend to store received location data in a file so that I can review historical data for debugging and analysis.

## Core Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Create a local backend server using Node.js and Express.
- Implement a single POST endpoint at `/api/location`.
- The endpoint must accept JSON payloads containing `latitude` and `longitude` fields (e.g., `{"latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.0060}`).
- Upon receiving valid location data, the server must log the data to the console.
- Upon receiving valid location data, the server must append the data to a text file (e.g., `location_data.txt`).
- The server must respond with a `200 OK` status and a JSON message `{"status": "success"}` for successful data receipt.
- The server must respond with a `400 Bad Request` status for invalid or missing `latitude` or `longitude` fields in the request body.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The local server should be responsive for development and testing purposes.
- **Maintainability:** The server code should be clean, well-structured, and easy to understand.
- **Security:** For local development, no advanced security measures (like API keys or authentication) are required at this stage.

## Visual Design
No visual assets provided.

## Reusable Components
### Existing Code to Leverage
- None identified, as this is a new local backend service.

### New Components Required
- A new Node.js/Express application to serve as the local backend.
- A new file (e.g., `location_data.txt`) for storing received location data.

## Technical Approach
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js.
- **API:** A single POST endpoint `/api/location`.
- **Data Handling:** Parse incoming JSON, validate `latitude` and `longitude`, log to console, and append to a local file.
- **Error Handling:** Implement middleware or specific route logic to catch and respond to malformed requests with a `400 Bad Request`.
- **Testing:** Manual testing by sending requests from the mobile app or a tool like Postman/cURL.

## Out of Scope
- Deployment to any cloud environment.
- Implementation of advanced security features (e.g., authentication, authorization).
- Handling of additional data points beyond `latitude` and `longitude`.
- Persistent storage beyond a simple text file (e.g., database integration).
- Frontend UI for the local backend server.

## Success Criteria
- The local backend server successfully starts and listens for requests.
- The mobile application can successfully send location data to the `/api/location` endpoint.
- Valid location data is correctly logged to the console and appended to `location_data.txt`.
- The server responds with `200 OK` for valid requests and `400 Bad Request` for invalid requests.
