# Spec Requirements: local-backend-for-location-data

## Initial Description
i need a spec for making mock api into real one. i need to make a local backend server to receive the location data the app sends

## Requirements Discussion

### First Round Questions

**Q1:** For the backend server, I'm assuming a simple Node.js with Express setup would be sufficient for a local environment. Is that correct, or do you have another framework in mind?
**Answer:** yes, local device will be the backend server for hosting api.

**Q2:** I'm thinking the server should have a single POST endpoint, like `/api/location`, to receive the location data. Does that sound right?
**Answer:** yes, POST endpoint should do.

**Q3:** For the location data itself, I assume we'll receive a JSON object with `latitude` and `longitude` fields, like `{"latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.0060}`. Is this the format you expect?
**Answer:** not that i have one in mind, but the one you suggested seems fine.

**Q4:** When the server receives the location data, should it just log it to the console for now, or should we store it in a temporary file?
**Answer:** let's do both, make it console log it and write it down on a text file

**Q5:** Should the server send a specific response back to the app after receiving the data? I'm assuming a simple `200 OK` with a message like `{"status": "success"}` is enough.
**Answer:** yes, simple 200 OK sign with message will do.

**Q6:** For error handling, I'll assume we should send back a `400 Bad Request` if the location data is missing or in the wrong format. Is that a correct assumption?
**Answer:** yes, we should do that

**Q7:** Are there any other data points we should expect to receive from the app, besides latitude and longitude?
**Answer:** not at the moment.

**Q8:** Should we consider any security measures for this local endpoint, like a simple API key, or is it okay to leave it open for now since it's for local development?
**Answer:** leave it open, since it's local

**Q9:** What should be considered out of scope for this spec? For instance, I'm assuming we are not deploying this to a cloud environment at this stage.
**Answer:** no i'm not going to deploy this to any could service. it will run only locally.

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
- Create a local backend server.
- The server should host a POST endpoint `/api/location`.
- The endpoint should receive location data as a JSON object with `latitude` and `longitude`.
- The server should log the received location data to the console.
- The server should write the received location data to a text file.
- The server should respond with `200 OK` and `{"status": "success"}` on successful receipt of data.
- The server should respond with `400 Bad Request` for missing or malformed location data.

### Reusability Opportunities
- None identified.

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- Local backend server development.
- Handling of location data (latitude, longitude).
- Logging and saving location data to a file.
- Basic success and error responses.

**Out of Scope:**
- Deployment to a cloud environment.
- Security measures beyond basic error handling for this local endpoint.
- Additional data points beyond latitude and longitude at this stage.

### Technical Considerations
- Backend framework: Node.js with Express.
- No security measures for the local endpoint.
