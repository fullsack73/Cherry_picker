# Frontend Verification Report: Local Backend for Location Data

## Summary
This report addresses the request to verify frontend tasks for the "Local Backend for Location Data" spec.

## Verification Details
A review of the core specification document, `agent-os/specs/2025-10-27-local-backend-for-location-data/spec.md`, was conducted.

### Findings
- The "Out of Scope" section of the specification explicitly states that a "Frontend UI for the local backend server" is not part of this project.
- The `tasks.md` file contains no tasks assigned to any frontend roles. All work is designated for backend and testing engineers.

## Conclusion
There are no frontend implementation or verification tasks associated with this specification. The work is confirmed to be backend-only. No further action is required from a frontend verifier role.
