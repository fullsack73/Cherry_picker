# Task Breakdown: Local Backend for Location Data

## Overview
Total Tasks: 2
Assigned roles: api-engineer, testing-engineer

## Task List

### Backend Server Implementation

#### Task Group 1: Local Backend Server
**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** None

- [x] 1.0 Complete local backend server implementation
  - [x] 1.1 Write 2-8 focused tests for the `/api/location` endpoint
    - Test valid data submission (latitude, longitude)
    - Test invalid data submission (missing/malformed fields)
    - Test correct success response (200 OK, {"status": "success"})
    - Test correct error response (400 Bad Request)
  - [x] 1.2 Set up a Node.js Express project
    - Initialize `package.json`
    - Install `express`
  - [x] 1.3 Create a POST `/api/location` endpoint
    - Accept JSON payload with `latitude` and `longitude`
    - Validate `latitude` and `longitude` are present and valid numbers
  - [x] 1.4 Implement logging to console
    - Log the received `latitude` and `longitude` to the console
  - [x] 1.5 Implement writing to a text file
    - Append received `latitude` and `longitude` to `location_data.txt`
  - [x] 1.6 Implement success response
    - Send `200 OK` with `{"status": "success"}`
  - [x] 1.7 Implement error response
    - Send `400 Bad Request` for invalid/missing data
  - [x] 1.8 Ensure backend server tests pass
    - Run ONLY the 2-8 tests written in 1.1
    - Verify endpoint functionality and error handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The 2-8 tests written in 1.1 pass.
- The Node.js Express server starts successfully.
- The `/api/location` endpoint correctly receives, logs, and saves valid location data.
- The server returns appropriate success and error responses.

### Overall Testing and Verification

#### Task Group 2: Test Review & Gap Analysis
**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1

- [x] 2.0 Review existing tests and fill critical gaps only
  - [x] 2.1 Review tests from Task Group 1
    - Review the 2-8 tests written by api-engineer (Task 1.1)
  - [x] 2.2 Analyze test coverage gaps for THIS feature only
    - Identify critical user workflows that lack test coverage (e.g., end-to-end flow from app to server)
    - Focus ONLY on gaps related to this spec's feature requirements
  - [x] 2.3 Write up to 10 additional strategic tests maximum
    - Add maximum of 10 new tests to fill identified critical gaps
    - Focus on integration points and end-to-end workflows (e.g., using `curl` or a simple client to test the endpoint)
  - [x] 2.4 Run feature-specific tests only
    - Run ONLY tests related to this spec's feature (tests from 1.1 and 2.3)
    - Verify critical workflows pass

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature-specific tests pass (approximately 6-18 tests total).
- Critical user workflows for this feature are covered.
- No more than 10 additional tests added by testing-engineer.
- Testing focused exclusively on this spec's feature requirements.

## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:
1. Backend Server Implementation (Task Group 1)
2. Overall Testing and Verification (Task Group 2)
